##Perceptron

In this small project, my first Perceptron neural network is provided, the essence of the program solving the problem of binary classification. only in the case of perceptron.py everything works not so correctly and the data there are linear-indivisible, but at least visually
it will be seen that if you add hidden layers or increase the collication of neurons, the program is simple, but gives a small understanding that and how it works
